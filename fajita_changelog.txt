crDroid 10.10
_Kernel 4.9, retrofit dynamic partitions, release-keys signed_

Changes since v10.9 (22 October) release:
- November 2024 Android Security Bulletins (android-14.0.0_r67) merged from upstream AOSP & LineageOS.
- Changes from upstream LineageOS:
  - I have no idea what all, but they're always hard at work doing amazing stuff that benefits everyone.
  - Pulled in the latest dummy libqti-perfd-client patches (not yet officially merged) from LineageOS gerrit.
  - Updated device-specific tree & kernel sources from lineage-21 branch as of end of November. Merged some stuff from general qcom_sdm845 kernel, updated proprietary blobs extract related stuff, nothing huge. Work has shifted to Android 15 bringup.
- Upstream changes from crDroid ROM sources:
  - Updated translations.
  - Fixes for memory leaks & calculations backported from 15.0 branch work in frameworks/base.
  - We also seem to have the adjustable statusbar content padding controls in crDroid Settings again, woo!
- Device-specific things I can't stop screwing around with:
  - Fixed up things regarding doze & pocketmode. You should enable BOTH the "prevent accidental wakeup" toggle under "Settings > Display", and the "Pocket detection" toggle under "Settings > crDroid Settings > Miscellaneous".
  - Also, switching to using LineageOS sensor-based doze customization instead of the crDroid framework ones, since it actually works properly in this configuration to let Ambient Display go to sleep when the proximity sensor is covered (like being in your pocket).
  - Dunno, I'm sure there was a lot of stuff tested out & tweaked, but I honestly do not remember. Life is busy.
- "Misc bugfixes and improvements."
- Added new bugs so I'll have something to fix later. :D

Release Notes:
- If you get a "verification failed" error when trying to OTA update, it means you're coming from an older version that was using test-keys or older signing keys. You need to update from recovery in that case (does not require wiping data; does require a computer & working USB cable & platform-tools).
- TL;DR make sure you do the following setup steps or don't bother submitting bug reports:
  - Go to Settings > Apps > Default Apps > tap the Gear (settings) icon next to crDroid Home (the default launcher) to open "Home settings" > Recents > turn OFF the "Shake phone to clear all tasks" toggle switch (it causes terrible SystemUI slowdowns & crashes after a couple hours).
  - Make sure to enable or disable BOTH "Settings > Display > Prevent accidental wake-up" and "Settings > crDroid Settings > Miscellaneous > Pocket detection" toggles together; it might do strange things with only one or the other.
  - [Optional if you use Oneplus Camera/Gallery] Go to https://gitlab.com/crdroidandroid/android_vendor_oneplus_apps/-/tree/14.0/sdm845/vendor/priv-app?ref_type=heads and download the APKs for OnePlusCamera and OnePlusGallery, then install them (it will ask you if you want to update the existing apps; choose yes each time).
  - [Optional if you use Oneplus Camera/Gallery] Go get this thing https://mega.nz/file/UHpDQS4L#FGKPas4_OM2Z5b5iE1R0zNZKUEa069uPJ7NAiluViXI and put it into Internal Storage > Android > obb > com.oneplus.gallery since it doesn't download correctly in-app due to sepolicy things I can't be bothered with in Android 14 (or don't if you don't care about OP Gallery being able to do image classification).
- To use "Device As Webcam" feature, connect USB to a computer, and in the USB mode notification, instead of "charging this device" or "File Transfer/Android Auto", choose the new "Webcam" option from the list. Ta da!
- You should probably just leave USB-OTG mode toggle on and let the USB Gadget HAL worry about it -- but it can be useful if USB port configuration gets stuck in an invalid state after using certain peripherals, or the port connector is failing and has intermittent connection problems; unplug & turn toggle off & back on to fix.
- Force USB 2.0 Fastcharge mode toggle will let you increase requested charging current *when connected to a computer or hub* to 900mA, up from 500. It also breaks DASH charging and possibly other Qualcomm quick charging methods when enabled, so don't forget to turn it off again afterwards for better compatibility with most charging bricks.
- Leave "AdrenoBoost" in Settings > DeviceExtras at "0" unless you have a specific game/app that responds well to cranking it up to 3... but be aware that this might make notification/QS shade jank even worse. 1 & 2 are basically pointless, but left in there for the sake of completion.
- Sensor-based doze customizations are now in "Settings > Display > Lock screen > Ambient Display" options (no longer using crDroid doze).
- If you have trouble with certain apps/games not being able to connect while on mobile data, try editing the mobile APN settings for your current SIM, and change APN protocol to IPv4/IPv6 and save. I think converting CarrierConfig to RRO actually fixed this issue!
- If performance seems bad or drain seems high and you have GApps installed, try disabling "Hey Google!" hotword detection.

Known issues:
_Look, none of this is really deal-breaking for most people. Things work well as a daily driver, all major systems work as they should as far as I can tell (or at least as well as in upstream LineageOS), battery life tends to be average-to-great depending on usage, etc._
- Upstream crDroid/LineageOS/Qualcomm/Google issues:
  - SAFETYNET/PLAY INTEGRITY MAY NOT PASS. It's a cat & mouse game, and they can change the rules on their end at any time, and have been doing so frequently. This is not considered a bug. The ROM devs try this or that strategy, and it takes me forever to get updates releases pushed, and then it's out of date by the time you get it. Sorry. Hate Google, not me. Change to a better bank & use the website instead of a crappy "app", and complain loudly while you threaten to take your money somewhere else that doesn't make broken apps requiring Google's spyware in order to function.
  - As of Android 13, we're using the source-built AOSP implementations for bluetooth & NFC, since it's not possible to continue with the old prebuilt QTI vendor blobs & implementation. Some things don't work as well; nothing I can do about it.
  - The "QR Code Scanner" lockscreen shortcut option does not get enabled for use until you add the "QR Scanner" QS tile & use it. (not sure if this is still true?)
  - Wallpapers & Styles can cause a SystemUI crash if you swap clock faces & colors too rapidly, too many times before settling on something. It's a stupid/funny reason, I hope devs can figure out what to DO about it. (not sure if this is still true?)
  - Using "Hold handle to search" feature in Gesture Navigation settings is basically broken.
  - If you use Google One/Google Drive for automatic system backups, then Seedvault is gonna cause problems in the background (and possible complain at you on each boot). Connect USB to computer & open a terminal and run the following command: `pm disable-user --user 0 com.stevesoltys.seedvault` to disable Seedvault.
- crDroid OP6/6T-specific issues:
  - Go do the setup things in the Release Notes section; really. Or else I will ignore your bug reports. So there.
  - For some people, the "update app with same version of app but installed as user" approach to fixing OnePlus Camera doesn't work and it STILL has black screen on app launch & crashes shortly thereafter. I don't know why, and don't have time to fix. It's an ugly hack in the first place, and I don't have time to make it better right now.
